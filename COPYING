The baseline JPEG code in src/lib/jpegb uses the Independent JPEG Group's
compression/decompression code. For details on its copyright and
redistribution, see the included file src/lib/jpegb/README. All other
code was public domain, and any portion of it could be used without
restrictions because it was created with U.S. government funding. The
original software was produced by NIST, an agency of the U.S.
government, and by statute is not subject to copyright in the
United States. Recipients of this software assume all responsibilities
associated with its operation, modification, and maintenance. To
request a copy of the public domain version software free of charge
on CD-ROM, please send an email request to the nist authors. When the
project was placed on sourceforge and various reorganization, cleanups,
autoconfing, and other work occured; the author(sjp) of this new work
decided to not place his new work under the public domain. His work
is availible under a combination of GNU LGPL, and/or MPL licenses.
There are no Warranties, it's AS IS; see below for details.
This work still contains much that should still be considered as
being in the public domain, however to avoid infringing on
copyrights please ask for the original version from NIST, if for
some reason the GNU LGPL and/or MPL is too restrictive for your purposes..

In source code an acceptible notice for me would be

The GNU Lesser General Public License, or GNU LGPL for short.
    This is a free software license, but not a strong copyleft license, because it permits linking with non-free modules. It is compatible with the GNU GPL.
Between version 2 and 2.1, the GNU LGPL was renamed from the GNU Library General Public License to the GNU Lesser General Public License to better reflect its actual purpose. Namely, it is not just for libraries.


http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html

The Mozilla Public License (MPL).
    This is a free software license which is not a strong copyleft;
unlike the X11 license, it has some complex restrictions that
make it incompatible with the GNU GPL. That is, a module
covered by the GPL and a module covered by the MPL cannot
legally be linked together.

    However, MPL 1.1 has a provision (section 13) that allows
a program (or parts of it) to offer a choice of another license
as well. If part of a program allows the GNU GPL as an alternate
choice, or any other GPL-compatible license as an alternate
choice, that part of the program has a GPL-compatible license.
